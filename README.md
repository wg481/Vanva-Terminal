# Vanva Terminal
Vanva Terminal is part of a Vanva subseries of products.
Just kidding, I'm not rich enough to own a company, but I can write some pretty mean (stupid) software.

## What on Earth is this?
This is a project in Python 2.7, in simple terms.
In larger terms, it is a terminal. It was originally inteded as a simple project for me to test my knowledge of Python, and I still work on it occasionally. I thought it would be best to upload to Github so I can get help/advice for the terminal.

## What is it for?
Nothing. If you want, you can use it as a replacement terminal on your computer.

## What is the difference between Terminal.py and bTerminal.py?
Terminal.py is the official release of the Terminal. This should be safe to run and contains the official features.
bTerminal.py is the beta release, containing features that are tested but have no assurity in working correctly.

## How do I work on it?
Fork the project, take bTerminal.py, add something to it, and set up a pull request. If the features are good, nonmalicious, useful, and well designed, the code will be added to the main branch.
