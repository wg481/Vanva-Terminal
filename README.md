# Vanva Terminal
Vanva Terminal is part of a Vanva subseries of products.
Just kidding, I'm not rich enough to own a company, but I can write some pretty mean (stupid) software.

## What on Earth is this?
This is a project in Python 2.7, in simple terms.
In larger terms, it is a terminal. It was originally inteded as a simple project for me to test my knowledge of Python, and I still work on it occasionally. I thought it would be best to upload to Github so I can get help/advice for the terminal.

## What is it for?
Nothing. If you want, you can use it as a replacement terminal on your computer.
