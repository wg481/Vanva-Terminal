# Vanva Terminal
Vanva Terminal started as a concept project and has now evolved into something I work on during class to eliminate the complexity of using CMD/PowerShell. While it isn't that
difficult, a text based terminal could be useful to help people who cannot quite figure out a command run commands with specal syntax that is easier to understand and is more
straightforward.


## What is the difference between releases?
Terminal.py is the official release of the Terminal. This should be safe to run and contains the official features. <br>
cTerminal.py is short for canaryTerminal, which features the latest features. cTerminal gets the most work.
Xenolith Edition (xTerminal.py) is a port of canaryTerminal to Python 3.


## How do I run it?
 - Download a Terminal file.
 - Download and install Python. (2.7 for Terminal, cTerminal. 3.x for Xenolith.)
 - Run the file in IDLE or the command line.


### What are Codecs?
Codecs are custom built modules which can be submitted. Please read codecs.md for more information.
