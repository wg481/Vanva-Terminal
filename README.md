# Vanva Terminal
Vanva Terminal is part of a Vanva subseries of products.
Just kidding, I'm not rich enough to own a company, but it is part of the Vanva product line.

## What on Earth is this?
This is a project in Python 2.7, in simple terms.
In larger terms, it is a terminal. It was originally inteded as a simple project for me to test my knowledge of Python, and I still work on it occasionally. I thought it would be best to upload to Github so I can get help/advice for the terminal.

## What is it for?
Nothing. If you want, you can use it as a replacement terminal on your computer.

## What is the difference between Terminal.py, bTerminal.py, and cTerminal.py?
Terminal.py is the official release of the Terminal. This should be safe to run and contains the official features. <br>
bTerminal.py is short for betaTerminal, containing features that are tested but have no assurity in working correctly. <br>
cTerminal.py is short for canaryTerminal, which features the latest features. cTerminal gets the most work.

## Why is cTerminal a version point ahead of the rest of them?
Currently, there are no new features, only minor bug fixes. Once a new feature is developed, the version number will be updated.

## How do I work on it?
Fork the project, take bTerminal.py, add something to it, and set up a pull request. If the features are good, nonmalicious, useful, and well designed, the code will be added to the main branch.

## How do I run it?
 - Download a Terminal file.
 - Download and install Python 2.7 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/
 - Run the file in IDLE or the command line.


### What are Codecs?
Codecs are custom built modules which can be submitted. Please read codecs.md for more information.
